GENESIS WP-SHRINKING HEADER

Simple CSS and scripts to add fading, shrinking headers to Genesis themes on WordPress.  Detects screen size and does not shrink when on screens that would require a smaller or hamburger menu.

INSTALLATION
1. Create new folder under your Genesis child theme called '43folders' (or anything else, but remember it in later steps)
2. Copy customstyling.css and customscripts.js there
3. Add the language in 'enqueue_scripts.php' to your functions.php file.
